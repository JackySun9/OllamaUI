# System Prompt Learning Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide will help you master system prompts using your Ollama WebUI frontend. System prompts are powerful tools that shape how AI models behave, respond, and interact with users.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Set up your environment:**
   ```bash
   # Start the backend
   python api.py
   
   # Start the frontend (in another terminal)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Select a model** in the interface before testing system prompts

### What You'll Learn
- **Basic Concepts**: Understanding what system prompts are and how they work
- **Practical Application**: Using different prompt types for various tasks
- **Comparison Techniques**: Systematically testing different approaches
- **Advanced Strategies**: Creating sophisticated, custom prompts

## üìö Learning Modules

### Module 1: System Prompt Basics
**Goal**: Understand the fundamentals of system prompts

**Exercises**:
1. **Start with no system prompt**
   - Ask: "Explain quantum physics"
   - Note the style and approach

2. **Apply a basic system prompt**
   - Use: "You are a helpful AI assistant"
   - Ask the same question
   - Compare the responses

3. **Try a specific role**
   - Use: "You are a patient teacher explaining complex topics to beginners"
   - Ask the same question again
   - Notice the difference in explanation style

**Key Takeaway**: System prompts dramatically change how AI responds to the same input.

### Module 2: Role-Based Prompts
**Goal**: Explore how different roles affect AI behavior

**Prompt Examples to Test**:

```
üé≠ Creative Writer
"You are a creative writing assistant with expertise in storytelling, poetry, and creative expression. Help users develop compelling narratives, interesting characters, and vivid descriptions."

üßÆ Math Tutor  
"You are a patient and encouraging math tutor. Break down complex problems into manageable steps. Show your work clearly, explain the reasoning behind each step, and check for understanding."

üë®‚Äçüíª Code Reviewer
"You are an experienced software engineer conducting code reviews. Analyze code for correctness, best practices, performance, security, and maintainability. Provide constructive feedback."

üé® Art Critic
"You are a knowledgeable art critic with expertise in various art movements, techniques, and cultural contexts. Provide insightful analysis of artworks and artistic concepts."
```

**Exercise**: 
- Test each role with the question: "How would you approach creating something beautiful?"
- Compare how each role interprets and responds to this question

### Module 3: Prompt Engineering Techniques

#### 3.1 Specificity
**Bad**: "You are helpful"
**Good**: "You are a senior software engineer specializing in Python web development with 10+ years of experience in Django and FastAPI"

#### 3.2 Behavior Guidelines
**Example**:
```
You are a helpful coding assistant. Follow these guidelines:
- Always ask clarifying questions before providing solutions
- Explain your reasoning step by step
- Provide working code examples
- Include error handling where appropriate
- Suggest testing approaches
```

#### 3.3 Output Format Control
**Example**:
```
Structure all responses as:
1. **Summary**: Brief overview of the topic
2. **Detailed Explanation**: In-depth information
3. **Example**: Practical demonstration
4. **Next Steps**: Suggested follow-up actions
```

#### 3.4 Context and Constraints
**Example**:
```
You are helping a complete beginner learning to code. Use simple language, avoid jargon, and always provide examples. If you must use technical terms, explain them clearly.
```

### Module 4: Comparative Analysis
**Goal**: Learn to systematically compare different prompting approaches

**Exercise**: Use the comparison tool to test these prompts with the same input:

**Prompt A**: 
```
You are a helpful AI assistant.
```

**Prompt B**: 
```
You are a Socratic teacher. Instead of giving direct answers, guide students to discover solutions through thoughtful questions. Ask probing questions that help them think critically and arrive at understanding on their own.
```

**Test Input**: "How does photosynthesis work?"

**Analysis Points**:
- Information delivery method
- Level of detail
- Teaching approach
- User engagement strategy

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Tone Test
Create prompts that produce these different tones for the same content:
- **Professional**: Formal, business-like responses
- **Casual**: Friendly, conversational responses  
- **Academic**: Scholarly, detailed responses
- **Humorous**: Light-hearted, entertaining responses

**Test Question**: "Explain how email works"

### Exercise 2: The Expertise Ladder
Create prompts for different expertise levels:
- **Beginner**: Simple explanations, basic concepts
- **Intermediate**: More detail, some technical terms
- **Expert**: Complex analysis, advanced concepts

**Test Question**: "Explain machine learning"

### Exercise 3: The Format Challenge
Create prompts that produce different output formats:
- **Bullet Points**: Structured, scannable lists
- **Narrative**: Story-like explanations
- **Q&A**: Question and answer format
- **Step-by-Step**: Procedural instructions

**Test Question**: "How to bake a cake"

## üèÜ Advanced Challenges

### Challenge 1: The Multi-Role Prompt
Create a system prompt that combines multiple roles:
```
You are a senior software engineer and technical writer who also teaches programming. When answering questions:
- Provide technically accurate information (engineer)
- Explain concepts clearly and engagingly (teacher)  
- Structure responses for easy reading (technical writer)
```

### Challenge 2: The Adaptive Prompt
Create a prompt that adapts to the user's level:
```
You are an adaptive tutor. First, assess the user's knowledge level by asking a clarifying question, then adjust your explanation accordingly. Always confirm understanding before moving to more complex concepts.
```

### Challenge 3: The Constraint Challenge
Create a prompt with specific constraints:
```
You are a creative writing coach who only responds in exactly 3 sentences. The first sentence should inspire, the second should provide practical advice, and the third should encourage action.
```

## üìä Evaluation Criteria

When testing your prompts, evaluate based on:

### Effectiveness
- Does it achieve the intended behavior?
- Is the AI following the guidelines?
- Does it maintain consistency?

### Clarity
- Are instructions unambiguous?
- Is the role well-defined?
- Are expectations clear?

### Robustness
